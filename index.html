                Note from Solemn: I am in no way a Web Developer, so please be patient as I continue to build this new skill. Ideally, I will be opting for more functionality over looks. Given that I work with data in my regular job, you will find I like to keep most of my information in tables as that is where I am most conformatble. I am always open to suggestions and recommendations. Please feel free to message me @SolemnXYZ on Discord or @SolemnMessiah on PokeNexus. Lastly, and most importantly, a huge thank you to everyone who has helped with SolemnBot and NexusFC!
